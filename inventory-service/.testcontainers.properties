# Testcontainers configuration to optimize Docker client initialization
# This file helps reduce the time Testcontainers takes to initialize Docker client
#
# Note: This file can be placed in:
# 1. Project root (this location) - affects only this project
# 2. User home directory (~/.testcontainers.properties) - affects all projects
#
# For Windows with Docker Desktop, the NpipeSocketClientProviderStrategy is typically fastest.
# If you experience slow Docker client initialization, ensure Docker Desktop is running
# and consider placing this file in your home directory.

# Enable Ryuk container reuse (container cleanup utility)
ryuk.container.image=testcontainers/ryuk:0.5.1

# Disable checksum validation for faster startup (use with caution in production)
checks.disable=true

# Docker client strategy (Windows with Docker Desktop)
# Uncomment the line below if you want to force a specific strategy:
# docker.client.strategy=org.testcontainers.dockerclient.NpipeSocketClientProviderStrategy
